/* your mission: 

1. Make all the + buttons add 1 to the score of the hole. Do not allow the score to exceed double the par. 
2. Make all the - buttons subtract 1 from the score of the hole. Do not allow the score to be negative!
3. Make the "Over" column display the difference, score - par, of the hole.
4. Make a table row's background color yellow if and only if that table row has a nonzero score.
5. Make the HTML table row with id="totals" display appropriate totals. Totals should be computed only for holes that have yellow-highlighted nonzero scores. Like the yellow-highlighted table rows above, the "totals" table row background color must be yellow if and only if it has a nonzero score. 
6. Add to the Action column a new button, C, which clears the current score for a given hole, and re-sets the table row background color to default.
7. Replace HTML table row code with JavaScript code that appends table rows. That is, delete the HTML elements with ID's 1 through 18, and write a function that loops 18 times, appending the appropriate DOM elements with ID's 1 through 18.  
8. Add a "RESET" button which clears all user-entered data. Use addEventListener method to add functionality to the button. See: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp. 
9. Add an "ABOUT" button which displays the message, "Golf Scorecard 1.0. All rights reserved."  Use an arrow function to add the "ABOUT" button to the DOM. See: https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_arrow_function.asp.
10. Add a "FONT" button which toggles the font size of the entire app, from/to smaller to/from larger.
*. Advanced (optional): put circles around scores that are birdies, and squares around scores that are bogeys!
